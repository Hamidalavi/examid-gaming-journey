# Examid's Noob to Pro Gaming Journey

> [!TIP]
**Mouse & Keyboard**

> [!NOTE]
**Start as a Noob**:
0. Start with laptop in 2021
1. Holding the wrist and arm in fixed place and rest fingers far from WASD and top numbers on keyboard to click Shift and Ctrl easily, but it's a wrong habit
2. Using W with just a point finger then ASD with thumb finger
3. Frames, ping, packet loss and response time didn't matter and was a casual player
4. Though how to use WASD with three fingers and got lots of keyboard controls. In the beginning it was very difficult and I was like a cripple. After one week (Playing Far Cry 3), it has become my true habit. Because I wanted to start Live Stream
5. Bought a Gaming PC in 11jan 2022
6. Frames and response time did matter and I wanted to be a pro instead of casual
7. Seeing others' game setting and being a parrot (also see the others' chair and table position, keyboard and mouse grips)
8. I decided to be myself with my situation and eye issue instead of seeing others
9. After being myself, I realized that the CPU was not strong enough to become a pro player
10. Leaned both lower and upper back on the chair
11. Relaxed my body to the most comfortable position
12. Starts hybrid aming; use both wrist and arm for bigger movements, perfect tracks and shots

> [!NOTE]
**Being a Pro**:
13. Make my mouse grip in my best comfortable situation; not using death grip
14. Decided to push and fully rest my arm and abit wrist instead of floating on air cuz of wrist and arm fatigue. It's happened after 2 years (like dinner seat posture)
15. Ignoring the arm friction with an arm sleeves. Because the place of Examid lives is very hot and humid and the arm moves very hardly
16. Using aggressive claw grip cuz of hand and fingers' breathing as well (impossible to fatigue)
17. My fingertips are very slightly pinching from back of mouse (abit lifting the mouse) like a phone tripad legs (fingers) and the base of tripad (palm). in this situation, even the fingers touch the mousepad, there is no more friction will added
18. Pre-Lock enemies with centering and not reseting the mouse when focusing on enemies
19. Aim goes like a pro with lowering the tension, touch fingers to mouse near the mousepad and wrist abit in air (like fight mode). With this situation, I can reset the mouse position easily
20. When the thumb, pinky, and ring fingers are positioned nearly parallel to the table, the aim becomes exceptionally smooth and accurate (fluid and precise)
21. Starts using dynamic fingertip grip (ignoring number 17 and 20 with this grip), so there are three parts which I can explain this mixing grip:
> A: Doing fingertip grip as a default, I mean there is a little space between mouse and palm
>> B: My pinky, ring and thumb fingers are NOT positioned nearly parallel to the mousepad
>>> C: For fast movement and reaction, pushing my fingers down. NOTE: do not always push your fingers down, push only in sensitive situations! Because it causes a hand fatigue and reducing the accuracy
22. Congratulations, Examid is now going to be a Pro Player (not yet!)

**Controller**

> [!NOTE]
**Start as a Noob**:
0. Bought just a PS5 controller (not console) in 11jan 2022
1. Using four fingers for handling games and always saw my hand and fingers. Two thumb fingers for the L/R sticks, and the other two index fingers for buttons and triggers
2. I always paid attention to the controller instead of the game
3. Though how to use claw grip with four fingers and got lots of controls. It was very difficult at first and I was like a cripple. Then practice this grip in Far Cry 3 game exactly like my KBM journey
4. Starts with six fingers and practice hard on this grip

> [!NOTE]
**Being a Pro**:
5. Bought a Nacon Revolution 5 controller with four back paddles
6. Using all of my ten fingers for handling games. Yeah, it's very difficult and it feels impossible at first time
7. Practice in very high sensitivity (20 in Call of Duty) to make movement better and faster
8. Bought a controller freek and my aim has improved alot
9. Since the Nacon Revolution 5 has a magnetic sticks, I tried to set the dead zone to zero for precise aiming and tracking
10. Pinky and ring fingers are fully covered under the controller for best paddle clicking experience
11. I control the sticks with the first knuckle (exactly behind the nail), it's very accurate to aim. I want to get used to this situation, I think it's a good habit

**PC Hardwares**
0. Bought a normal laptop in **1nov 2015** with **1 core and 2 threads CPU**, then **1GB graphic drive**
1. Upgraded the **Hard Disk Drive (HDD)** to **Solid State Drive (SSD)**. To do that, we removed the DVD writer hardware
2. Bought a Gaming PC in **11jan 2022** with **Sharkoon TG4** case (see pc-specs repository to see full information)
3. After two years, I decided to upgrade the CPU from **AMD Ryzen 5 5600X** to **Intel(TM) Core-17 14700K**
4. My bad, the current motherboard **ASUS ROG B550-F Gaming WIFI** didn't support that CPU. I had to chnage it to **ASUS PRIME Z790-P WIFI**
5. Another bad luck is the current Read Access Memory (RAM) which is **Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 2x16GB 3200MHz CL16** didn't support at **ASUS ROG B550-F Gaming WIFI** motherboard, that's an another reason which I changed motherboard. So, I bought **G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 2x16GB 6000MHz CL36** instead. Because it's a DDR5 type and it supports the D5 motherboard socket
6. I decided to upgrade my CPU cooler from **Thermaltake 1x Fan | Liquid** to **DeepCool LS720 Black**. This cooler doing great and reduced the temperature more than 2x time (75°c to 30°c)
7. My bad luck is endless, because the **DeepCool LS720 Black** cooler did not fit in the **Sharkoon TG4** case and I had to buy **Deepcool CH510 Mesh Digital** case
8. The year 2022 to 2024 was very terrible. Due to a small mistake in the **microcode 0x129**, it caused the CPU voltage to reach the highest level and as a result, the CPU's life time was reduced. Therefore, programs and games would crash without any warning
9. I searched alot and I also updated everything and drivers one by one but the crashes not fixed. I decided fo change the network and display settings but it not helped me. I tried my last chance, which is to remove most of the drivers and programs that might be affecting the GPU and CPU as well as the RAM but the crashing still remains
10. Stress took over my whole body and I thought that the graphics card or the power supply had burned out. Then, I quickly installed **Windows 11 Pro** and told myself that maybe everything will be fine this time. It was unbelievable, but the problem was still persistent and the softwares and games were crashing alot
11. I decided to shoot the last shot in the dark. I updated the BIOS of the motherboard from 1220 (2022) to 1663 (2024) without a UPS (emergency power). This operation took ten minutes in total, but it was the most stressful day of my life. Because if the electricity in the house was cut off during the update or the current was weak, the motherboard would break
12. After this perilous journey, the crashing problems were finally solved. In addition, the security and performance of the computer increased greatly. Even the appearance and UI of windows programs and settings changed and became similar to the Android version
