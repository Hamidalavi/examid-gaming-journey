# Examid's Noob to Pro Gaming Journey

> [!TIP]
**Mouse & Keyboard**

> [!NOTE]
**Start as a Noob**:
0. Start with laptop in **2021**
1. Holding the **wrist** and **arm** in fixed place and rest fingers far from **WASD** and top numbers on keyboard to click **Shift** and **Ctrl** easily, but it's a wrong habit
2. Using **W** with just a point finger then **ASD** with thumb finger
3. Frames, ping, packet loss and response time didn't matter and was a casual player
4. Though how to use **WASD** with three fingers and got lots of keyboard controls. In the beginning it was very difficult and I was like a cripple. After one week (playing **Far Cry 3**), it has become my true habit. Because I wanted to start **Live Stream**
5. Bought a Gaming PC in **11jan 2022**
6. Frames and response time did matter and I wanted to be a pro instead of casual
7. Seeing others' game setting and **being a parrot**; also see the others' chair and table position, keyboard and mouse grips
8. I decided to be myself with my situation and **eye issue** instead of seeing others
9. After being myself, I realized that the CPU was not strong enough to become a pro player
10. Leaned both lower and upper back on the chair and relaxed my body to the most comfortable position
11. Starts **hybrid aming**; use both **wrist** and **arm** for bigger movements, perfect tracks and shots

> [!NOTE]
**Being a Pro**:
12. Make my mouse grip in my best comfortable situation; not using **death grip**
13. Decided to push and fully rest my arm and abit wrist instead of floating on air cuz of wrist and arm fatigue. It's happened after 2 years (like dinner seat posture)
14. Ignoring the arm friction with an **arm sleeve**. Because the place of Examid lives is very hot and humid and the arm moves very hardly
15. Pre-Lock enemies with **centering** and **not reseting** the mouse when focusing on enemies
16. Starts using **dynamic grip**, so there are three common grips which I can explain and also describe my mixing grip and I use all of them in different situations (mostly use my own grip):
> A: Doing **fingertip grip** as a default, I mean there is a little space between mouse and wrist; the palm is hovering over the mouse. This grip is suitable for web browsering, MOBA and RTS style games and in-game menus
>> B: Doing **palm grip**; from exactly where I hold the mouse with my fingers, I push the metacarpal head towards the mouse a bit. This grip is suitable for most of games with more stability and less movement with applied some frictions
>>> C: Doing **claw grip**; from exactly where I hold the mouse with my fingers, I curl my fingers; now the lower part of the metacarpal touches the mouse a bit. It's suitable for balancing between high agility or movement and precision for shooter style games
>>>> D: My grip is normal fingertip grip in all types of games. The left side of ring and pinky fingers are touching the mouse and keep it secure; **this makes horizontal aiming without skew or diagonal direction**. Then the thumb, ring and pinky fingers touch the mouse pad abit to avoid forcibly applying pressure to the mouse to create friction. It's confusing at the first time and you think the thumb finger can't click the side buttons of the mouse with fingertip grip; but it can click them very easily by moving the thumb's muscle (not thumb finger itself) instead of fixed place. Now I **DON'T** need to put my whole hand on the mouse so that my thumb reaches the side buttons of the mouse, which would cause friction and ruin my aiming. In this technique, I can be **fast and smooth** in aiming also on the normal cloth mouse pads

> [!WARNING]
**These frictions and restrictions that are created by pressure on the mouse are not felt on glass mouse pads or skypads, and it makes no difference where the fingers and hand are placed on the mouse. In any case, the mouse moves without friction**

> [!IMPORTANT]
**I personally tested over 200 grips and came to the conclusion that there is no difference between these grips. Even with palm, you can be as comfortable, fast and smooth as claw and fingertip. Don't pay too much attention to what the ESports coaches say and play with whichever grip you are most comfortable with**

17. I raised the height of the table (or I lowered the height of the seat), then I opened my **armpits** because I didn't want to raise my shoulders anymore. As a result, I played with the best speed and freedom of action and less arm friction while aming
18. These two fators **reaction** and **smoothness** are very important. I tried hard to learn these factors and my aim became very fast and smooth like other pro players. I mean my aim is very fast and when I see the enemy while centering, I slow down my aiming so I can get more accurate shots. There is no such thing as **flick shot**; in fact, switching on the target in a short time is what people call **flick** and it's achieve by training
19. Now I'm **focusing on the enemies** instead of center dot, crosshair and environment. I can play shooter games even without crosshair; it just indicates the middle of the monitor, the main thing is focusing on every pixel you want to do
20. Congratulations, Examid is now going to be a Pro Player at **mouse and keyboard**

**Controller**

> [!NOTE]
**Start as a Noob**:
0. Bought just a **PS5** controller (not console) in **11jan 2022**
1. Using four fingers for handling games and always saw my hand and fingers. Two thumb fingers for the L/R sticks and front buttons, and the other two index fingers for L/R buttons and triggers
2. I always paid attention to the controller instead of the game
3. Though how to use **claw grip** with four fingers and got lots of controls. It was very difficult at first and I was like a cripple. Then practice this grip in **Far Cry 3** game exactly like my **KBM** journey
4. Starts with six fingers and practice hard on this grip

> [!NOTE]
**Being a Pro**:
5. Bought a **Nacon Revolution 5 Pro** controller with four back paddles
6. Using eight and sometimes all of my ten fingers for handling games. Yeah, it's very difficult and it feels impossible at first time
7. Practice in very high sensitivity (20 in Call of Duty) to make movement better and faster
8. Bought a **controller freek** and my aim has improved alot
9. Since the **Nacon Revolution 5 Pro** has a magnetic sticks, I tried to set the dead zone to zero for precise aiming and tracking
10. **Pinky** and **ring** fingers are fully covered under the controller for best paddle clicking experience
11. Controlling the sticks with the first knuckle (exactly behind the nail), it's very accurate to aim
12. When using ten fingers, I kept my index and middle fingers up to prevent clicking the triggers, but I prefer to using eight fingers
13. Depending on the direction of aiming, I use 360° of the thumb knuckle for controlling the thumbstick. Let me explain it:
> A: When I want to aim upwards, I use the right side of my thumb to push up
>> B: When I want to aim to the right, I use the thumb knuckle itself to push right
>>> C: When I want to aim downwards, I use the left side of my thumb to push downwards
>>>> D: When I want to aim to the left, I use the top side of my thumb or sometimes thumb knuckle itself to push left

> [!IMPORTANT]
**For the left thumb finger, I do the opposite of these movements**

14. These two fators **reaction** and **smoothness** are very important. I tried hard to learn these factors and my aim became very fast and smooth like other pro players. I mean my aim is very fast and when I see the enemy while centering, I slow down my aiming by controlling the thumbstick, so I can get more accurate shots. There is no such thing as **flick shot**; in fact, switching on the target in a short time is what people call **flick** and it's achieve by training
14. Congratulations, Examid is now going to be a Pro Player at controller

**This gaming journey belongs only to Examid and has nothing to do with other gamers. Everyone's journey is different according to their circumstances and situations**

> [!TIP]
**PC Hardwares**
0. Bought a normal laptop in **1nov 2015** with **1 core and 2 threads CPU**, then **1GB graphic drive**
1. Upgraded the **Hard Disk Drive (HDD)** to **Solid State Drive (SSD)**. To do that, we removed the DVD writer hardware from laptop
2. Bought a Gaming PC in **11jan 2022** with **Sharkoon TG4** case (see pc-specs repository to see full information)
3. After two years, I decided to upgrade the CPU from **AMD Ryzen 5 5600X** to **Intel(TM) Core-i7 14700K**. Because after buying a **Logitech G Pro X Superlight Wireless 100-25600 DPI** gaming mouse, due to the high polling rate, the processor did not have enough power to process programs and games, and I had to set the polling rate lower. Then we assembled the GPU, CPU, PSU, RAM and CPU cooler by ourselves
4. My bad, the current motherboard **ASUS ROG B550-F Gaming WIFI** didn't support that CPU. I had to chnage it to **ASUS PRIME Z790-P WIFI**
5. Another bad luck is the current Read Access Memory (RAM) which is **Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 2x16GB 3200MHz CL16** didn't support at **ASUS PRIME Z790-P WIFI** motherboard. So, I bought **G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 2x16GB 6000MHz CL36** instead. Because its type is a DDR5 and it supports the D5 motherboard socket
6. I decided to upgrade my CPU cooler from **Thermaltake 1x Fan | Liquid** to **DeepCool LS720 Black**. This cooler doing great and reduced the temperature more than 2x time (75°c to 30°c)
7. My bad luck is endless, because the **DeepCool LS720 Black** cooler did not fit in the **Sharkoon TG4** case and I had to buy **Deepcool CH510 Mesh Digital** case
8. The year 2022 to 2024 was very terrible. Due to a small mistake in the **microcode 0x129**, it caused the CPU voltage to reach the highest level and as a result, the CPU's life time was reduced. Therefore, programs and games would crash without any warning
9. I searched alot and I also updated everything and drivers one by one but the crashes not fixed. I decided fo change the network and display settings but it not helped me. I tried my next chance, removing those drivers and programs that might be affecting the GPU and CPU as well as the RAM but the crashing still remains
10. Stress took over my whole body and I thought that the graphics card or the power supply had burned out. Then, I quickly installed **Windows 11 Pro** and told myself that maybe everything will be fine this time. It was unbelievable, but the problem was still persistent and the softwares and games were crashing alot
11. I decided to shoot the last shot in the dark. I updated the BIOS of the motherboard from 1220 (2022) to 1663 (2024) without a UPS (emergency power). This operation took ten minutes in total, but it was the most stressful day of my life. Because if the electricity in the house was cut off during the update or the current was weak, the motherboard would break
12. After this perilous journey, the crashing problems were finally solved. In addition, the security and performance of the computer increased greatly (frame increased by 50+ and audio became very clear). Even the appearance and UI of windows programs and settings changed and became similar to the Android/IOS version

> [!WARNING]
**I recommend never updating the system BIOS without an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). If the power goes out or the current is weak during the update, the motherboard will burn out and I will not take responsibility for it**

13. Bought a **WLA-006 Ergo Four-Monitor Support Stand (Clamp Mode)** because I wanted the desk to be more clean. On the other hand, the monitor stand doesn't bother me. The main reason is that the monitor comes forward so that my eyes can see the screen more clearly
