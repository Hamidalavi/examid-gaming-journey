# Examid's Noob to Pro Gaming Journey

> [!NOTE]
**Start as a Noob**:
0. Start with laptop in 2021
1. Holding the wrist and arm in fixed place and rest fingers far from WASD and top numbers on keyboard to click Shift and Ctrl easily, but it's a wrong habit
2. Using W with just a point finger then ASD with thumb finger
3. Frames, ping, packet loss and response time didn't matter and was a casual player
4. Though how to use WASD with three fingers and got lots of keyboard controls. In the beginning it was very difficult and I was like a cripple. After one week (Playing Far Cry 3), it has become my true habit. Because I wanted to start Live Stream
5. Bought a Gaming PC in 11jan 2022
6. Frames and response time did matter and I wanted to be a pro instead of casual
7. Seeing others' game setting and being a parrot (also see the others' chair and table position, keyboard and mouse grips)
8. I decided to be myself with my situation and eye issue instead of seeing others
9. After being myself, I realized that the CPU was not strong enough to become a pro player
10. Leaned both lower and upper back on the chair
11. Relaxed my body to the most comfortable position
12. Starts hybrid aming; use both wrist and arm for bigger movements, perfect tracks and shots

> [!NOTE]
**Being a Pro**:
13. Make my mouse grip in my best comfortable situation; not using death grip, a little space between palm and wrist cuz of hand and fingers' breathing as well (impossible to fatigue)
14. Decided to push and fully rest my arm and abit wrist instead of floating on air cuz of wrist and arm fatigue. It's happened after 2 years (like dinner seat posture)
15. Ignoring the arm friction with arm sleeves and learn how to reseting the mouse position. Because the place of Examid lives, is very hot and humid and the arm moves very hard
16. Using fingertip grip to select options, claw or palm grip for aim (Using all of them while gaming)
17. Pre-Lock enemies with centering and not reseting the mouse when focusing on enemies
18. Aim goes like a Pro with moderating the tension
