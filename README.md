# Examid's Noob to Pro Gaming Journey

> [!TIP]
**Mouse & Keyboard**

> [!NOTE]
**Start as a Noob**:
0. Start with laptop in **2021**
1. Holding the **wrist** and **arm** in fixed place and rest fingers far from **WASD** and top numbers on keyboard to click **Shift** and **Ctrl** easily, but it's a wrong habit
2. Using **W** with just a point finger then **ASD** with thumb finger
3. Frames, ping, packet loss and response time didn't matter and was a casual player
4. Though how to use **WASD** with three fingers and got lots of keyboard controls. In the beginning it was very difficult and I was like a cripple. After one week (playing **Far Cry 3**), it has become my true habit. Because I wanted to start **Live Stream**
5. Bought a Gaming PC in **11jan 2022**
6. Frames and response time did matter and I wanted to be a pro instead of casual
7. Seeing others' game setting and **being a parrot**; also see the others' chair and table position, keyboard and mouse grips
8. I decided to be myself with my situation and **eye issue** instead of seeing others
9. After being myself, I realized that the CPU was not strong enough to become a pro player
10. Leaned both lower and upper back on the chair and relaxed my body to the most comfortable position
11. Starts **hybrid aming**; use both **wrist** and **arm** for bigger movements, perfect tracks and shots

> [!NOTE]
**Being a Pro**:
12. Make my mouse grip in my best comfortable situation; not using **death grip**
13. Decided to push and fully rest my arm and abit wrist instead of floating on air cuz of wrist and arm fatigue. It's happened after 2 years (like dinner seat posture)
14. Ignoring the arm friction with an **arm sleeve**. Because the place of Examid lives is very hot and humid and the arm moves very hardly
15. Pre-Lock enemies with **centering** and **not reseting** the mouse when focusing on enemies. I also tried hard to learn very fast micro movement aiming without resetting the mouse position. Because I used to always raise my hand after this fast aiming method and this would cause my hand to get tired
16. Starts using **dynamic grip**, so there are three common grips which I can explain and also describe my mixing grip and I use all of them in different situations (mostly use my own grip):
> A: Doing **fingertip grip** as a default, I mean there is a little space between mouse and wrist; the palm is hovering over the mouse. This grip is suitable for web browsering, MOBA and RTS style games and in-game menus
>> B: Doing **palm grip**; from exactly where I hold the mouse with my fingers, I push the metacarpal head towards the mouse a bit. This grip is suitable for most of games with more stability and less movement with applied some frictions
>>> C: Doing **claw grip**; from exactly where I hold the mouse with my fingers, I curl my fingers; now the lower part of the metacarpal touches the mouse a bit. It's suitable for balancing between high agility or movement and precision for shooter style games
>>>> D: My grip is **feliform-like fingertip grip without too much curling my fingers** in all types of games with both two or three fingers above and each finger is used for one of these top three buttons which is similar to the cheetah's digitigrade feet (walking on toes); then move the mouse to the right side of hand (parallel to the pinky finger) and all the pinky finger joints hold the mouse, so other fingers are allowed to hold the mouse securely and also thumb finger can click the side buttons easily; **it's also makes horizontal aiming without skew or diagonal direction**

> [!WARNING]
**The mouse friction that are created by pressure on the mouse are also felt on glass mouse pads or skypads, but it's not noticeable; In any case, if the friction level is too high (specially in horizontal aiming), compensate for this friction by strafing for a long time; or have a rotating and circular aiming (which I don't recommend for competitive matches); then aim exactly opposite the left or right movement. BTW take care of mouse skate durability**

> [!IMPORTANT]
**I personally tested over 200 grips and came to the conclusion that there is no difference between these grips. Even with palm, you can be as comfortable, fast and smooth as claw and fingertip. Don't pay too much attention to what the ESports coaches say and play with whichever grip you are most comfortable with**

17. I raised the height of the table (or I lowered the height of the seat), then I opened my **armpits** since I bought a **SkyPAD Wallhack SP-004 Glass Gaming Mousepad** and became a **full arm** player; because I didn't want to raise my shoulders anymore. As a result, I played with the best speed and freedom of action and less arm friction while aming
18. These two fators **reaction** and **smoothness** are very important. I tried hard to learn these factors and my aim became very fast and smooth like other pro players. Now I can click on objects or items in MMORPG games without accidentally moving the game window; I mean I have both **reactive** and **focused** clicks with these factors I mentioned above
20. Now I'm **focusing on enemies** instead of center dot, crosshair, environment and movements in any pov (hipfire, ADS, strafe, leaning, mounting a gun, tac stance and etc). I can play shooter games even without crosshair; it just indicates the middle of the monitor, the main thing is focusing on every pixel you want to do
21. Blinking is like changing the magazine of a gun. My eyes are always open when I focus on the enemy. When I'm done, I relieve eye fatigue with a wink
22. Finally, **the brain optimized the hand and fingers' movements** and now my entire focus is on the game
23. Congratulations, Examid is now going to be a Pro Player at **mouse and keyboard**

**Controller**

> [!NOTE]
**Start as a Noob**:
0. Bought just a **PS5** controller (not console) in **11jan 2022**. Although 15 years ago we had Sega, Nintendo (NES), Game Boy, Atari and PS1 consoles
1. Using four fingers for handling games and always saw my hand and fingers. Two thumb fingers for the L/R joysticks and front buttons, and the other two index fingers for L/R buttons and triggers
2. I always paid attention to the controller instead of the game
3. Though how to use **claw grip** with four fingers and got lots of controls. It was very difficult at first and I was like a cripple. Then practice this grip in **Far Cry 3** game exactly like my **KBM** journey
4. Starts with six fingers and practice hard on this grip

> [!NOTE]
**Being a Pro**:
5. Bought a **Nacon Revolution 5 Pro** controller with four back paddles in **24oct 2024**
6. Using eight and sometimes all of my ten fingers for handling games. Yeah, it's very difficult and it feels impossible at first time
7. Practice in very high sensitivity to make movement better and faster
8. Bought a **controller freek** in one month later and my aim has improved alot
9. Since the **Nacon Revolution 5 Pro** has a magnetic joysticks, I tried to set the dead zone to zero for precise aiming and tracking in shooter style games. In other style games I use the default settings
10. Cover the controller with middle, ring and pinky fingers; then use the middle knuckle of index finger for pressing R1/L1 buttons, and top knuckle of index finger for pressing R2/L2 buttons

> [!IMPORTANT]
**Hold the controller in your hand as if you were placing it on a table. This means that you can easily place the controller on your hand without straining, getting tired, or slipping. For professional controllers, you can use weights to make them fit more comfortably in your hand and make playing easier. For this reason, my recommendation is you pay attention to the direction in which the controller is placed in your hand. I also don't recommend to overthink about the joysticks and controller direction; just play and have fun with your controller; just optimize your brain for this controller direction**

11. When using ten fingers, I kept my index and middle fingers up to prevent clicking the triggers, but I prefer to using eight fingers
12. Compensate for analog sticks' friction by **clearing the dust and debris around the joysticks**. I also put my both thumbs' fingertip on center of each joystick; but to aim, I just push the joysticks to the sides instead of the middle. **I just use the middle of joysticks for LS/RS buttons, not for aim**

> [!WARNING]
**If you try to use the middle of the joystick to aim, you will encounter slight friction that will cause your aim to be distorted or you will feel like the controller is broken**

13. Now that I've figured out how to remove the friction between both joysticks, I can now aim with all the thumb joints. Before, it was just the fingertips. It's like the wrist (fingertip) and forearm (the rest of the thumb finger joints) in my **KBM** journey
14. Practice in high difficulty in some games to be a non-casual controller player
15. Use strafing for a better accuracy
16. These two fators **reaction** and **smoothness** are very important. I tried hard to learn these factors and my joystick aim became very fast and smooth like other pro players
17. Now I'm **focusing on enemies** instead of center dot, crosshair, environment and movements in any pov (hipfire, ADS, strafe, leaning, mounting a gun, tac stance and etc). I can play shooter games even without crosshair; it just indicates the middle of the monitor, the main thing is focusing on every pixel you want to do
18. Blinking is like changing the magazine of a gun. My eyes are always open when I focus on the enemy. When I'm done, I relieve eye fatigue with a wink
19. Finally, **the brain optimized the fingers' movements and positions** and now my entire focus is on the game
20. Congratulations, Examid is now going to be a Pro Player at **controller**

**Touch**

> [!NOTE]
**Start as a Noob**:
0. Bought a **Galaxy Note 3 Neo** in **23jul 2013**. It was my first touchscreen phone which I bought
1. I've always loved games; so as usual, I installed a bunch of games on my phone before I could use any social apps
2. I used one finger for typing (thumb or index) in portrait mode and holding the phone with the other hand
3. I was very casual, playing games in landscape mode with two thumb fingers in shooter style games. Others could be fine with two fingers

> [!NOTE]
**Being a Pro**:
4. I practiced playing three fingers a lot; at first my index finger hurts and the knuckle was numb. But I felt very good about the pain and saw it as going to the gym
5. After two weeks, the pain and numbness were gone; and I could **subconsciously and intuitively** play games with four or even six fingers. It was like an achievement that had been unlocked
6. I hold the phone on my fingers and top of metacarpal (instead of resting it on my whole palm) to give my fingers and thumb muscles more space to move and doing touch more comfortable
7. Playing **fast hand** games which makes the brain perform touches faster and more accurately
8. Fingertip of each fingers touch the screen for more precision, clicking and tracking

> [!IMPORTANT]
**Fingertip touch position may change slightly as you pay attention to the game; so I don't recommend to overthink about mechanics and touching directions; just play and have fun with your phone**

9. I do a lot of strafing while aiming, because it makes me more accurate when shooting, because there is no friction in touch screen (if you have minor friction, use finger sleeves)
10. Now I'm **focusing on enemies** instead of center dot, crosshair, environment and movements in any pov (hipfire, ADS, strafe, leaning, mounting a gun, tac stance and etc). I can play shooter games even without crosshair; it just indicates the middle of the touch screen, the main thing is focusing on every phone pixel you want to do
11. Blinking is like changing the magazine of a gun. My eyes are always open when I focus on the enemy. When I'm done, I relieve eye fatigue with a wink
12. Finally, the brain **optimized the fingers' movements** and now my entire focus is on the game
13. Congratulations, Examid is now going to be a Pro Player at **touch**

**My Gaming Journey**
0. Bought a normal laptop in **1nov 2015** with **1 core and 2 threads CPU**, then **1GB graphic drive**
1. Upgraded the **Hard Disk Drive (HDD)** to **Solid State Drive (SSD)**. To do that, we removed the DVD writer hardware from laptop
2. Bought a Gaming PC in **11jan 2022** with **Sharkoon TG4** case (see pc-specs repository to see full information)
3. After two years, I decided to upgrade the CPU from **AMD Ryzen 5 5600X** to **Intel(TM) Core-i7 14700K**. Because after buying a **Logitech G Pro X Superlight Wireless 100-25600 DPI** gaming mouse, due to the high polling rate, the processor didn't have enough power to process programs and games, and I had to set the polling rate lower. Then we assembled the GPU, CPU, PSU, RAM and CPU cooler by ourselves
4. My bad, the current motherboard **ASUS ROG B550-F Gaming WIFI** didn't support that CPU. I had to chnage it to **ASUS PRIME Z790-P WIFI**
5. Another bad luck is the current Read Access Memory (RAM) which is **Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 2x16GB 3200MHz CL16** didn't support at **ASUS PRIME Z790-P WIFI** motherboard. So, I bought **G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 2x16GB 6000MHz CL36** instead. Because its type is a DDR5 and it supports the D5 motherboard socket
6. I decided to upgrade my CPU cooler from **Thermaltake 1x Fan | Liquid** to **DeepCool LS720 Black**. This cooler doing great and reduced the temperature more than 2x time (75°c to 30°c)
7. My bad luck is endless, because the **DeepCool LS720 Black** cooler did not fit in the **Sharkoon TG4** case and I had to buy **Deepcool CH510 Mesh Digital** case
8. The year 2022 to 2024 was very terrible. Due to a small mistake in the **microcode 0x129**, it caused the CPU voltage to reach the highest level and as a result, the CPU's life time was reduced. Therefore, programs and games would crash without any warning
9. I searched alot and I also updated everything and drivers one by one but the crashes not fixed. I decided fo change the network and display settings but it not helped me. I tried my next chance, removing those drivers and programs that might be affecting the GPU and CPU as well as the RAM but the crashing still remains
10. Stress took over my whole body and I thought that the graphics card or the power supply had burned out. Then, I quickly installed **Windows 11 Pro** and told myself that maybe everything will be fine this time. It was unbelievable, but the problem was still persistent and the softwares and games were crashing alot
11. I decided to shoot the last shot in the dark. I updated the BIOS of the motherboard from 1220 (2022) to 1663 (2024) without a UPS (emergency power). This operation took ten minutes in total, but it was the most stressful day of my life. Because if the electricity in the house was cut off during the update or the current was weak, the motherboard would break
12. After this perilous journey, the crashing problems were finally solved. In addition, the security and performance of the computer increased greatly (frame increased by 50+ and audio became very clear). Even the appearance and UI of windows programs and settings changed and became similar to the Android/IOS version

> [!WARNING]
**I recommend never updating the system BIOS without an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). If the power goes out or the current is weak during the update, the motherboard will burn out and I will not take responsibility for it**

13. Bought a **WLA-006 Ergo Four-Monitor Support Stand (Clamp Mode)** because I wanted the desk to be more clean. On the other hand, the monitor stand doesn't bother me. The main reason is that the monitor comes forward so that my eyes can see the screen more clearly
14. Bought a **SkyPAD Wallhack SP-004 Glass Gaming Mousepad** and when I play with the mouse, it feels like I'm playing hockey, because the surface of the pad is so frictionless. It's a next era of gaming experience. For a month after purchasing, I was always afraid that the surface of the pad would be scratched or damaged, because there was a scratching sound when I moved the mouse; and since I had no experience before, I moved the mouse slowly and my aiming was terrible. Since I realized that hard surfaces (hard pad) always make noise, I got used to it and my aiming has gotten a lot better
15. Bought **DIY Universal PTFE Dots** mouse skate and put them around the **Logitech G Pro X Superlight Wireless** mouse to prevent the mouse from slipping. Now the bottom of the mouse is not flat and it's easier to reset the mouse (even on the flattest surface) and my hand doesn't get tired. I can always move the dot skates without stress; this means that this product can be installed or used multiple times. But flat skates are disposable and I have to throw them away in the trash after one time installation
16. Bought **Wallhack x X-Raypad Obsidian Pro Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMW-PE) Universal Plastic Dot Mouse Skates (Black)** and my aiming became much better and the friction was also drastically reduced
17. I had **LAZEK** surgery on my right eye and **ICL (implantable contact lens)** surgery on my left eye in **22apr 2025**, so I could play games without glasses and see everything more clearly and vividly. I also moved the monitor to the farthest point of the table, so I don't have to move my head much and can just focus on the screen with my eyes
